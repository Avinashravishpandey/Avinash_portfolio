            <p>Hey there! I’m Avinash Pandey, a final-year Computer Science Engineering student from the vibrant city of Varanasi, UP, studying at SHEAT College of Engineering. I'm a full-stack web developer with hands-on experience in the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js—and a solid command of Python, Java, C, and JavaScript.

                Recently, I wrapped up a Web Development Internship at Intern Certify, where I contributed to boosting platform efficiency, worked in agile teams, and enhanced front-end performance to improve user satisfaction.
                
                One of my proudest achievements is building a full-featured Gym Management System, where I applied real-world concepts like JWT-based authentication, role-based access control, and performance optimization techniques.
                
                I've earned certifications in Python, Java, and Web Development, and even secured a top rank in a national Ideathon competition. I'm always eager to grow, build meaningful tech, and bring bold, innovative ideas to life.

                <h3>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h3>
                <p>Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple two-player game played on a 3×3 grid. One player uses "X" and the other uses "O". Players take turns marking the spaces in the grid. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—wins. If all nine spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.</p>
